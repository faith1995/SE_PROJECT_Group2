One should understand that with a small business one needs to be mindful of the cashflow required to obtain materials. Hence my recommendation is that the quotes be split to indicate materials cost and the payment associated with such a cost. A second aspect that one needs to be mindful of is the guarantee.

He also replaced the pipe and valve by the weir that was damaged and he adjusted the pressure on four fountain water spouts so that they all had a thin water sheet piping out evenly from all four spouts.","areas":["North Riding, Olivedale"],"rating":10,"feedback":"He was punctual and came out on a Sunday morning to quote and then was on time for the day we arranged the following Wednesday for him to do the job. The quote was received within 24 hours.  He was honest and said he would first try acid to remove the rust and would only resort to painting if the acid didn't work.  I really appreciated this as a repaint would have been very expensive.  He did the job perfectly and all the rust was removed. Our pool looks new again.  He replaced a damaged valve and pipe at the weir and sorted the water pressure issue we had that caused one of the spouts not to flow water. All four spouts now have an equal thin water sheet pouting out. I recommend him and will use him again.
