We will be using an Agile SDLC approach to software development SRUM in particular.

Choice of architecture: 3-tier client-server architecture.

Appropriate front-end user interface method: We will be delevoping our system to work on a web browser. We will be using a javascript front-end framework - ReactJs, NodeJs.\\

A back-end service for our project:
We will be using Node.Js and Nginx as a reverse proxy server for our front-end. 
For our back-end we will be using PHP and Nginx.
We will be using a relational database management system for our project \textit{(mysql)}\\

Other supporting software: We will be using Google Maps API in our system to show the location of the premises where the doctors operate.

\subsection*{Project Overview}

For our project, we have a small clinic with 5 dentists. We are designing an
interactive system where patients can interact with the clinic via a website where
they can register (first time visitors) and get details for signing in later before
the appointment to fill in required forms, and where already registered patients
can sign in, make appointments and also check and update their personal details
or any other changes if there need be.
